Today I downloaded and installed blender on my current workhorse laptop and got familar with the basics and moved into keyframe animations as a project for the day.

### History with blender before this repo:

I had really only used blender as a (difficult to use) video editor in the past. That didn't stick and so the idea to learn it went to the background, always peeking at me since I love to see cool stuff and lots of cool stuff comes from blender.
