I made a layout and a few renders I'll add to the repo here now

For this one I used the chair model I had created before (not journaled) with a premade folding table to create a layout for an upcoming classroom event.

The front desk scan looks interesting, so I set up a camera to render it.

These renders had a 10 second limit and Denoise on, because I wanted them quick.

Today I downloaded and installed blender on my current workhorse laptop and got familar with the basics and moved into keyframe animations as a project for the day.

### History with blender before this repo:

I had really only used blender as a (difficult to use) video editor in the past. That didn't stick and so the idea to learn it went to the background, always peeking at me since I love to see cool stuff and lots of cool stuff comes from blender.
